1. In the `transferSync` function, the timeout for obtaining the transfer status via `engine_->getTransferStatus` is calculated as `timeout = transfer_timeout_nsec_ + length`, where `length` represents the size of a single request in nanoseconds (ns). The value of `transfer_timeout_nsec_` can be configured via the environment variable `MC_TRANSFER_TIMEOUT`. The minimum allowed value is 5 seconds, and the default is 30 seconds.
2. For Mooncake P2P Handshake on the host side, the socket receive timeout is set to a default of 60 seconds.
3. For Ascend Transport relying on out-of-band communication on the host side, the receive timeout is set to 120 seconds.
4. In Ascend Transport's `hccl_socket` module on the device side, the link establishment timeout is controlled by `HCCL_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`, while the execution timeout is configured via the `HCCL_EXEC_TIMEOUT` environment variable. Additionally, the Ascend Transport implementation includes a keep-alive mechanism to prevent termination due to prolonged inactivity.
5. In Ascend Transport's `transport_mem` module on the device side, point-to-point RoCE communication between endpoints involves a connection handshake with a timeout of 120 seconds.
