## Description

Implemented cross-machine data transfer functionality in DataManager to enable P2P Store remote data access via RDMA/TCP.

Main Changes:

1. TransferDataToRemote - Transfers local data to remote client buffers
  - Stages non-DRAM tier data to temporary DRAM before transfer
  - Groups transfers by segment to minimize openSegment() calls
  - Supports scatter-gather across multiple segments
  - 10-second timeout polling with proper resource cleanup
2. TransferDataFromRemote - Receives data from remote client buffers
  - Receives to temporary DRAM, then copies to non-DRAM tiers if needed
  - Same optimizations and error handling as TransferDataToRemote
3. Bug Fixes:
  - Fixed scatter-gather offset calculation bug when buffers span multiple segments
  - Added comprehensive parameter validation (segment_name, buffer.addr, buffer.size)
  - Added early validation in ReadData/WriteData to catch errors before expensive operations
4. RefBuffer Helper Class - Wraps raw pointers as BufferBase for DataCopier operations

## How Has This Been Tested?

Ran 29 DataManager unit tests:
[==========] 29 tests from 1 test suite ran.
[  PASSED  ] 29 tests.

Test coverage:
- Put/Get/Delete operations (7 tests)
- Tier ID parameter handling
- Concurrent operations
- Allocation failure handling
- Key not found handling
- Put-Get-Delete sequence
- TransferDataToRemote validation (7 tests):
  - Invalid handle, empty buffers, empty segment name, null address, zero size, insufficient dest size
- TransferDataFromRemote validation (6 tests):
  - Invalid handle, empty buffers, empty segment name, null address, zero size, insufficient src size
- ReadData/WriteData validation (3 tests)
