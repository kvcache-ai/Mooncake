<h2 id="overview">üéâ Overview</h2>

Mooncake features a KVCache-centric disaggregated architecture that separates the prefill and decoding clusters. It also leverages the underutilized CPU, DRAM, and SSD resources of the GPU cluster to implement a disaggregated cache of KVCache. 

![architecture](image/architecture.png)

The core of Mooncake is its KVCache-centric scheduler, which balances maximizing overall effective throughput while meeting latency-related Service Level Objectives (SLOs) requirements. Unlike traditional studies that assume all requests will be processed, Mooncake faces challenges due to highly overloaded scenarios. To mitigate these, we developed a prediction-based early rejection policy. Experiments show that Mooncake excels in long-context scenarios. Compared to the baseline method, Mooncake can achieve up to a 525% increase in throughput in certain simulated scenarios while adhering to SLOs. Under real workloads, Mooncake‚Äôs innovative architecture enables <a href="https://kimi.ai/">Kimi</a> to handle 75% more requests.

- The bottom part of Mooncake is **Transfer Engine**, which supports rapid, reliable and flexible data transfer over TCP, RDMA, NVIDIA GPUDirect-based RDMA and and NVMe over Fabric (NVMe-of) protocols. Comparing with gloo (used by Distributed PyTorch) and TCP, Mooncake Transfer Engine has the lowest I/O latency.
- Based on **Transfer Engine**, we implemented the **P2P Store** library, supports sharing temporary objects (e.g., checkpoint files) among nodes in a cluster. It avoids bandwidth saturation on a single machine.
- Additionally, we modified vLLM so that **Transfer Engine** is integrated. It makes prefill-decode disaggregation more efficient by utilizing RDMA devices. 
- In the future, we plan to build **Mooncake Store** on the basis of **Transfer Engine**, which supports pooled KVCache for more flexible P/D disaggregation.

### Use Transfer Engine Standalone ([Guide](doc/en/transfer-engine.md))

Transfer Engine is a high-performance data transfer framework. Transfer Engine provides a unified interface to transfer data from DRAM, VRAM or NVMe, while the technical details related to hardware are hidden. Transfer Engine supports TCP, RDMA (InfiniBand/RoCEv2/eRDMA/NVIDIA GPUDirect) and NVMe over Fabric (NVMe-of) protocols.

#### Highlights
- **Efficient use of multiple RDMA NIC devices.** Transfer Engine supports the use of multiple RDMA NIC devices to achieve the *aggregation of transfer bandwidth*.

- **Topology aware path selection.** Transfer Engine can *select optimal devices* based on the location (NUMA affinity, etc.) of both source and destination.

- **More robust on temporary network error.** Once transmission fails, Transfer Engine will try to use alternative paths for data delivery automatically.

#### Performance
With 40 GB of data (equivalent to the size of the KVCache generated by 128k tokens in the LLaMA3-70B model), Mooncake Transfer Engine delivers up to **87 GB/s** and **190 GB/s** of bandwidth in 4√ó200 Gbps and 8√ó400 Gbps RoCE networks respectively, which are about **2.4x and 4.6x faster** than the TCP protocol.

### P2P Store  ([Guide](doc/en/p2p-store.md))
P2P Store is built on the Transfer Engine and supports sharing temporary objects between peer nodes in a cluster. P2P Store is ideal for scenarios like checkpoint transfer, where data needs to be rapidly and efficiently shared across a cluster. 
**P2P Store has been used in the checkpoint transfer service of Moonshot AI.**

#### Highlights
- **Decentralized architecture.** P2P Store leverages a pure client-side architecture with global metadata managed by the etcd service.

- **Efficient data distribution.** Designed to enhance the efficiency of large-scale data distribution, P2P Store *avoids bandwidth saturation* issues by allowing replicated nodes to share data directly. This reduces the CPU/RDMA NIC pressures of data providers (e.g., trainers).

#### Performance
Thanks to the high performance of Transfer Engine, P2P Stores can also distribute objects with full utilization of *hardware incoming bandwidth* (e.g., A 25Gbps NIC was used in the following figure, and the throughput of get replica is about 3.1 GB/s).

### vLLM Integration ([Guide v0.2](doc/en/vllm-integration-v0.2.md))
To optimize LLM inference, the vLLM community is working on supporting [disaggregated prefilling (PR 10502)](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/10502). This feature allows separating the **prefill** phase from the **decode** phase in different processes. The vLLM uses `nccl` and `gloo` as the transport layer by default, but currently it cannot efficiently decouple both phases in different machines.

We have implemented vLLM integration, which uses Transfer Engine as the network layer instead of `nccl` and `gloo`, to support **inter-node KVCache transfer** [(PR 10884)](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/10884). Transfer Engine provides simpler interfaces and more efficient use of RDMA devices. In the future, we plan to build Mooncake Store on the basis of Transfer Engine, which supports pooled prefill/decode disaggregation.

**_Update[Dec 16, 2024]: Here is the latest vLLM Integration ([Guide v0.2](doc/en/vllm-integration-v0.2.md)) that is based on vLLM's main branch._**

#### Performance
By supporting Topology Aware Path Selection and multi-card bandwidth aggregation, Mean TTFT of vLLM with Transfer Engine is up to 25% lower than traditional TCP-based transports.
In the future, we will further improve TTFT through GPUDirect RDMA and zero-copy.

| Backend/Setting                                         | Output Token Throughput (tok/s) | Total Token Throughput (tok/s) | Mean TTFT (ms) | Median TTFT (ms) | P99 TTFT (ms)|
|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| Transfer Engine (RDMA) | 12.06                           | 2042.74                        | 1056.76        | 635.00           | 4006.59       |
| TCP  | 12.05                           | 2041.13                        | 1414.05        | 766.23          | 6035.36       |

The above presents two samples from our trace dataset. The trace includes the timing of request arrivals, the number of input tokens, the number of output tokens, and the remapped block hash. To protect our customers' privacy, we applied several mechanisms to remove user-related information while preserving the dataset's utility for simulated evaluation. More descriptions of the trace (e.g., up to 50% cache hit ratio) can be found in Section 4 of the paper's Version 3.
