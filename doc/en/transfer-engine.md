# Transfer Engine

## Overview 
Mooncake Transfer Engine is a high-performance, zero-copy data transfer library designed around two core abstractions: Segment and BatchTransfer.

- [**Segment**](#segment) represents a contiguous address space that can be remotely read and written, which can be either non-persistent storage provided by DRAM or VRAM, known as **RAM Segment**, or persistent storage provided by NVMeof, known as **NVMeof Segment**.

- [**BatchTransfer**](#batchtransfer) encapsulates operation requests, specifically responsible for synchronizing data between a set of non-contiguous data spaces in one Segment and the corresponding spaces in another set of Segments, supporting Read/Write in both directions, thus acting like an asynchronous and more flexible AllScatter/AllGather.

As shown in the diagram, each specific client corresponds to a `TransferEngine`, which not only includes a RAM Segment but also integrates management for high-speed transfers across multiple threads and network cards. The RAM Segment, in principle, corresponds to the entire virtual address space of this `TransferEngine`, but in reality, only parts of it (known as a `Buffer`) are registered for (GPUDirect) RDMA Read/Write. Each Buffer can have separate permissions (corresponding to RDMA `rkey`, etc.) and network card affinity (e.g., preferred NICs for different types of memory).

Mooncake Transfer Engine provides interfaces through the `TransferEngine` class (located in `mooncake-transfer-engine/include/transfer_engine.h`), where the specific data transfer functions for different backends are implemented by the `Transport` class, currently supporting `TcpTransport`, `RdmaTransport`, and `NVMeoFTransport`.

### Segment
Segment represents a collection of source address ranges and target address ranges available during the data transfer process in Transfer Engine. That is, all local and remote addresses involved in `BatchTransfer` requests must be within the valid segment range. Transfer Engine supports the following two types of Segments.

#### 1. RAM Segment in Memory Address Space (DRAM, VRAM)
When each process starts, Transfer Engine automatically creates a segment named after its own `local_hostname` (see the initialization function of `TransferEngine`, which needs to be globally unique), which logically covers the entire memory address space, including storage media such as DRAM/VRAM. When using the `BatchTransfer` interface for transfer tasks, Transfer Engine automatically determines the corresponding hardware information to choose the best transfer method. **Each process has and only has one segment.** Other processes can reference the segment and complete read/write operations by calling the `openSegment` interface and passing the correct name.

In actual deployment, application systems usually only use part of the memory address space for data transfer, so Transfer Engine further divides the segment into multiple buffers internally. Each Buffer represents a contiguous address space located on the same device, and when users use the `BatchTransfer` interface to complete read/write operations, if referencing a RAM Segment, each read/write task must be within one of the valid buffers.

The memory range within a segment does not need to be contiguous, which means that multiple DRAM/VRAM address spaces can be allocated and included in the same segment.

In addition, Transfer Engine also supports registering some **local DRAM areas**, which are merely used as the local side storage space for data operations, such as the DRAM PageCache area of vLLM. It is also considered a part of the effective RAM Segment in the current process but cannot be referenced by other processes by calling the `openSegment` interface.

#### 2. NVMeof Segment
Transfer Engine also leverages the NVMeof protocol to support direct data transfer from files on NVMe to DRAM/VRAM via PCIe, without going through the CPU and achieving zero-copy. Users need to follow the instructions to mount remote storage nodes locally and use the `openSegment` interface for reference to complete data read/write operations.

### BatchTransfer

With the help of Transfer Engine, Mooncake Store can achieve local DRAM/VRAM reading and writing of specified parts in valid segments  through TCP, (GPUDirect) RDMA, NVMe-of protocols, etc.

| Remote ↓ Local → | DRAM | VRAM |
|----------|------|------|
| DRAM     | ✓    | ✓    |
| VRAM     | ✓    | ✓    |
| NVMe-of  | ✓    | ✓    |

- Local memcpy: If the target Segment is actually in the local DRAM/VRAM, direct data copy interfaces such as memcpy, cudaMemcpy are used.
- TCP: Supports data transfer between local DRAM and remote DRAM.
- RDMA: Supports data transfer between local DRAM/VRAM and remote DRAM. It supports multi-network card pooling and retry functions in implementation.
- cuFile (GPUDirect Storage): Implements data transfer between local DRAM/VRAM and Local/Remote NVMeof.

The BatchTransfer API uses an array of requests, which specify the operation type (READ or WRITE), data length, and local and remote memory addresses. The transfer operation is applicable to DRAM and GPU VRAM. The completion of these operations can be asynchronously monitored through the `getTransferStatus` API.

### Topology Aware Path Selection
Modern inference servers often consist of multiple CPU sockets, DRAM, GPUs, and RDMA NIC devices. Although it's technically possible to transfer data from local DRAM or VRAM to a remote location using any RDMA NIC, these transfers can be limited by the bandwidth constraints of the Ultra Path Interconnect (UPI) or PCIe Switch. To overcome these limitations, Transfer Engine implements a topology-aware path selection algorithm.

Before processing requests, each server generates a topology matrix and broadcasts it across the cluster. 
This matrix categorizes network interface cards (NICs) into preferred and secondary lists for various types of memory, which types are specified during memory registration. 
Under normal conditions, a NIC from the preferred list is selected for transfers, facilitating RDMA operations within the local NUMA or GPU Direct RDMA through the local PCIe switch only. 
In case of failures, NICs from both lists may be utilized.
The process involves identifying the appropriate local and target NICs based on the memory addresses, establishing a connection, and executing the data transfer.

![topology-matrix](../../image/topology-matrix.png)

For instance, as illustrated in figure above, to transfer data from buffer 0 (assigned to cpu:0) in the local node to buffer 1 (assigned to cpu:1) in the target node, the engine first identifies the preferred NICs for cpu:0 using the local server's topology matrix and selects one, such as mlx5_1, as the local NIC. Similarly, the target NIC, such as mlx5_3, is selected based on the target memory address. This setup enables establishing an RDMA connection from mlx5_1@local to mlx5_3@target to carry out RDMA read and write operations.

To further maximize bandwidth utilization, if a single request's transfer is internally divided into multiple slices if its length exeeds 16KB. 
Each slice might use a different path, enabling collaborative work among all RDMA NICs.

### Endpoint Management
Mooncake Store employs a pair of end-
points to represent the connection between a local RDMA
NIC and a remote RDMA NIC. In practice, each endpoint
includes one or more RDMA queue pair objects. Connec-
tions in Mooncake Store are established in an on demand manner;
endpoints remain unpaired until the first request is made.
To prevent a large number of endpoints from slowing down
request processing, Mooncake Store employs endpoint pooling,
which caps the maximum number of active connections. We
use the SIEVE algorithm to manage endpoint eviction.
If a connection fails due to link errors, it is removed from the
endpoint pools on both sides and re-established during the
next data transfer attempt.

### Fault Handling
In a multi-NIC environment, one common failure scenario is the temporary unavailability of a specific NIC, while other routes may still connect two nodes.
Mooncake Store is designed to adeptly manage such temporary
failures effectively. If a connection is identified as unavailable,
Mooncake Store automatically identifies an alternative, reachable
path and resubmits the request to a different RDMA NIC
device. Furthermore, Mooncake Store is capable of detecting prob-
lems with other RDMA resources, including RDMA contexts
and completion queues. It temporarily avoids using these
resources until the issue, such as a downed link, is resolved.

## Example: Transfer Engine Bench
The sample program provided in `mooncake-transfer-engine/example/transfer_engine_bench.cpp` demonstrates the basic usage of Transfer Engine by repeatedly reading/writing data blocks from the DRAM of the target node to the initiator node through the Transfer Engine interface. It can also be used to measure read and write throughput. Currently, the Transfer Engine Bench tool supports RDMA and TCP protocols.

After successfully compiling Transfer Engine, the test program `transfer_engine_bench` can be found in the `build/mooncake-transfer-engine/example` directory.

1. **Start the `metadata` service.** This service is used for the centralized highly available management of various metadata for Mooncake, including the internal connection status of Transfer Engine. It is necessary to ensure that both the initiator and target nodes can smoothly access this metadata service, so pay attention to:
   - The listening IP of the metadata service should not be 127.0.0.1; it should be determined in conjunction with the network environment. In the experimental environment, 0.0.0.0 can be used.
   - On some platforms, if the initiator and target nodes have set the `http_proxy` or `https_proxy` environment variables, it will also affect the communication between Transfer Engine and the metadata service.

   Transfer Engine support multiple kinds of metadata services, including `etcd`, `redis`, and `http`. The following describes how to start the metadata service using `etcd` and `http` as examples.

   1.1. **`etcd`**

   For example, the following command line can be used to start the etcd service:
      ```bash
      # This is 10.0.0.1
      etcd --listen-client-urls http://0.0.0.0:2379  --advertise-client-urls http://10.0.0.1:2379
      ```

   1.2. **`http`**

   For example, you can use the `http` service in the `mooncake-transfer-engine/example/http-metadata-server` example:
      ```bash
      # This is 10.0.0.1
      # cd mooncake-transfer-engine/example/http-metadata-server
      go run . --addr=:8080
      ```

2. **Start the target node.**
    ```bash
    # This is 10.0.0.2
    export MC_GID_INDEX=n
    ./transfer_engine_bench --mode=target \
                            --metadata_server=etcd://10.0.0.1:2379 \
                            --local_server_name=10.0.0.2:12345 \
                            --device_name=erdma_0
    ```
   The meanings of the various parameters are as follows:
   - The default value of the parameter corresponding to the environment variable `MC_GID_INDEX` is 0, which means that the Transfer Engine selects a GID that is most likely to be connected. Since this parameter depends on the specific network environment, the user has to set the value of the environment variable manually if the connection is hung. The environment variable `NCCL_IB_GID_INDEX` is equivalent to this function.
   - `--mode=target` indicates the start of the target node. The target node does not initiate read/write requests; it passively supplies or writes data as required by the initiator node.
      > Note: In actual applications, there is no need to distinguish between target nodes and initiator nodes; each node can freely initiate read/write requests to other nodes in the cluster.
   - `--metadata_server` is the address of the metadata server. Its form is `[proto]://[hostname:port]`. For example, the following addresses are VALID:
      - Use `etcd` as metadata storage: `"10.0.0.1:2379"`, `"etcd://10.0.0.1:2379"` or `"etcd://10.0.0.1:2379,10.0.0.2:2379"`
      - Use `redis` as metadata storage: `"redis://10.0.0.1:6379"`
      - Use `http` as metadata storage: `"http://10.0.0.1:8080/metadata"`
   - `--local_server_name` represents the address of this machine, which does not need to be set in most cases. If this option is not set, the value is equivalent to the hostname of this machine (i.e., `hostname(2)`). Other nodes in the cluster will use this address to attempt out-of-band communication with this node to establish RDMA connections.
      > Note: If out-of-band communication fails, the connection cannot be established. Therefore, if necessary, you need to modify the `/etc/hosts` file on all nodes in the cluster to locate the correct node through the hostname.
   - `--device_name` indicates the name of the RDMA network card used in the transfer process.
      > Tip: Advanced users can also pass in a JSON file of the network card priority matrix through `--nic_priority_matrix`, for details, refer to the developer manual of Transfer Engine.
   - In network environments that only support TCP, the `--protocol=tcp` parameter can be used; in this case, there is no need to specify the `--device_name` parameter.

   You can also specify `--auto_discovery` to enable discovery topology automatically, which generates a network card priority matrix based on the operating system configuration. Then, `--device_name` parameter is not required.
   ```
   ./transfer_engine_bench --mode=target \
                           --metadata_server=10.0.0.1:2379 \
                           --local_server_name=10.0.0.2:12345 \
                           --auto_discovery
   ```

1. **Start the initiator node.**
    ```bash
    # This is 10.0.0.3
    export MC_GID_INDEX=n
    ./transfer_engine_bench --metadata_server=10.0.0.1:2379 \
                            --segment_id=10.0.0.2:12345 \
                            --local_server_name=10.0.0.3:12346 \
                            --device_name=erdma_1
    ```
   The meanings of the various parameters are as follows (the rest are the same as before):
   - `--segment_id` can be simply understood as the hostname of the target node and needs to be consistent with the value passed to `--local_server_name` when starting the target node (if any).
   
   Under normal circumstances, the initiator node will start the transfer operation, wait for 10 seconds, and then display the "Test completed" message, indicating that the test is complete.

   The initiator node can also configure the following test parameters: `--operation` (can be `"read"` or `"write"`), `batch_size`, `block_size`, `duration`, `threads`, etc.

> If an exception occurs during execution, it is usually due to incorrect parameter settings. It is recommended to refer to the [troubleshooting document](troubleshooting.md) for preliminary troubleshooting.

### Sample Run

The following video shows a normal run as described above, with the Target on the right and the Initiator on the left, at the end of the test the Initiator reports the test duration (10 seconds), IOPS (379008 requests/s), and throughput (19.87 GiB/s). The throughput here exceeds the maximum throughput supported by a single card on the host computer used.

## Transfer Engine C/C++ API
Transfer Engine provides interfaces through the `TransferEngine` class (located in `mooncake-transfer-engine/include/transfer_engine.h`), where the specific data transfer functions for different backends are implemented by the `Transport` class, currently supporting `TcpTransport`, `RdmaTransport` and `NVMeoFTransport`.

### Data Transfer

#### TransferEngine::TransferRequest

The core API provided by Mooncake Transfer Engine is submitting a group of asynchronous `TransferRequest` tasks through the `submitTransfer` interface, and querying their status through the `getTransferStatus` interface. Each `TransferRequest` specifies reading or writing a continuous data space of `length` starting from the local starting address `source`, to the position starting at `target_offset` in the segment corresponding to `target_id`.

The `TransferRequest` structure is defined as follows:

```cpp
using SegmentID = int32_t;
struct TransferRequest
{
    enum OpCode { READ, WRITE };
    OpCode opcode;
    void *source;
    SegmentID target_id; // The ID of the target segment, which may correspond to local or remote DRAM/VRAM/NVMeof, with the specific routing logic hidden
    size_t target_offset;
    size_t length;
};
```

- `opcode` takes the values `READ` or `WRITE`. `READ` indicates that data is copied from the target address indicated by `<target_id, target_offset>` to the local starting address `source`; `WRITE` indicates that data is copied from `source` to the address indicated by `<target_id, target_offset>`.
- `source` represents the DRAM/VRAM buffer managed by the current `TransferEngine`, which must have been registered in advance by the `registerLocalMemory` interface.
- `target_id` represents the segment ID of the transfer target. The segment ID is obtained using the `openSegment` interface. Segments are divided into the following types:
  - RAM space type, covering DRAM/VRAM. As mentioned earlier, there is only one segment under the same process (or `TransferEngine` instance), which contains various types of Buffers (DRAM/VRAM). In this case, the segment name passed to the `openSegment` interface is equivalent to the server hostname. `target_offset` is the virtual address of the target server.
  - NVMeOF space type, where each file corresponds to a segment. In this case, the segment name passed to the `openSegment` interface is equivalent to the unique identifier of the file. `target_offset` is the offset of the target file.
- `length` represents the amount of data transferred. TransferEngine may further split this into multiple read/write requests internally.

#### TransferEngine::allocateBatchID

```cpp
BatchID allocateBatchID(size_t batch_size);
```

Allocates a `BatchID`. A maximum of `batch_size` `TransferRequest`s can be submitted under the same `BatchID`.

- `batch_size`: The maximum number of `TransferRequest`s that can be submitted under the same `BatchID`;
- Return value: If successful, returns `BatchID` (non-negative); otherwise, returns a negative value.

#### TransferEngine::submitTransfer

```cpp
int submitTransfer(BatchID batch_id, const std::vector<TransferRequest> &entries);
```

Submits new `TransferRequest` tasks to `batch_id`. The task is asynchronously submitted to the background thread pool. The total number of `entries` accumulated under the same `batch_id` should not exceed the `batch_size` defined at creation.

- `batch_id`: The `BatchID` it belongs to;
- `entries`: Array of `TransferRequest`;
- Return value: If successful, returns 0; otherwise, returns a negative value.

#### TransferEngine::getTransferStatus

```cpp
enum TaskStatus
{
  WAITING,   // In the transfer phase
  PENDING,   // Not supported
  INVALID,   // Ilvalid parameters
  CANNELED,  // Not supported
  COMPLETED, // Transfer completed
  TIMEOUT,   // Not supported
  FAILED     // Transfer failed even after retries
};
struct TransferStatus {
  TaskStatus s;
  size_t transferred; // How much data has been successfully transferred (not necessarily an accurate value, but it is a lower bound)
};
int getTransferStatus(BatchID batch_id, size_t task_id, TransferStatus &status)
```

Obtains the running status of the `TransferRequest` with `task_id` in `batch_id`.

- `batch_id`: The `BatchID` it belongs to;
- `task_id`: The sequence number of the `TransferRequest` to query;
- `status`: Output Transfer status;
- Return value: If successful, returns 0; otherwise, returns a negative value.

#### TransferEngine::freeBatchID

```cpp
int freeBatchID(BatchID batch_id);
```

Recycles `BatchID`, and subsequent operations on `submitTransfer` and `getTransferStatus` are undefined. If there are still `TransferRequest`s pending completion in the `BatchID`, the operation is refused.

- `batch_id`: The `BatchID` it belongs to;
- Return value: If successful, returns 0; otherwise, returns a negative value.

### Multi-Transport Management

The `TransferEngine` class internally manages multiple backend `Transport` classes.
And it will discover the toplogy between CPU/CUDA and RDMA devices automatically
(more device types are working in progress, feedbacks are welcome when the automatic discovery mechanism is not accurate),
and it will install `Transport` automatically based on the topology.

### Space Registration

For the RDMA transfer process, the source pointer `TransferRequest::source` must be registered in advance as an RDMA readable/writable Memory Region space, that is, included as part of the RAM Segment of the current process. Therefore, the following functions are needed:

#### TransferEngine::registerLocalMemory

```cpp
int registerLocalMemory(void *addr, size_t size, string location, bool remote_accessible);
```

Registers a space starting at address `addr` with a length of `size` on the local DRAM/VRAM.

- `addr`: The starting address of the registration space;
- `size`: The length of the registration space;
- `location`: The `device` corresponding to this memory segment, such as `cuda:0` indicating the GPU device, `cpu:0` indicating the CPU socket, by matching with the network card priority order table (see `installTransport`), the preferred network card is identified. You can also use `*`, Transfer Engine will try to automatically recognize the `device` corresponding to `addr`, if it fails to recognize the device, it will print a `WARNING` level log and use all network cards, no preferred network cards.
- `remote_accessible`: Indicates whether this memory can be accessed by remote nodes.
- Return value: If successful, returns 0; otherwise, returns a negative value.

#### TransferEngine::unregisterLocalMemory

```cpp
int unregisterLocalMemory(void *addr);
```

Unregisters the region.

- `addr`: The starting address of the registration space;
- Return value: If successful, returns 0; otherwise, returns a negative value.

### Segment Management and Metadata Format

TransferEngine provides the `openSegment` function, which obtains a `SegmentHandle` for subsequent `Transport` transfers.
```cpp
SegmentHandle openSegment(const std::string& segment_name);
```

- `segment_name`: The unique identifier of the segment. For RAM Segment, this needs to be consistent with the `server_name` filled in by the peer process when initializing the TransferEngine object.
- Return value: If successful, returns the corresponding `SegmentHandle`; otherwise, returns a negative value.

```cpp
int closeSegment(SegmentHandle segment_id);
```

- `segment_id`: The unique identifier of the segment.
- Return value: If successful, returns 0; otherwise, returns a negative value.

### HTTP Metadata Server

The HTTP server should implement three following RESTful APIs, while the metadata server configured to `http://host:port/metadata` as an example:

1. `GET /metadata?key=$KEY`: Get the metadata corresponding to `$KEY`.
2. `PUT /metadata?key=$KEY`: Update the metadata corresponding to `$KEY` to the value of the request body.
3. `DELETE /metadata?key=$KEY`: Delete the metadata corresponding to `$KEY`.

For specific implementation, refer to the demo service implemented in Golang at [mooncake-transfer-engine/example/http-metadata-server](../../mooncake-transfer-engine/example/http-metadata-server).

### Initialization

TransferEngine needs to initializing by calling the `init` method before further actions:
```cpp
TransferEngine();

int init(const std::string &metadata_conn_string,
         const std::string &local_server_name,
         const std::string &ip_or_host_name, 
         uint64_t rpc_port = 12345);
```
- `metadata_conn_string`: Connecting string of metadata storage servers, i.e., the IP address/hostname of `etcd`/`redis` or the URI of the http service.
The general form is `[proto]://[hostname:port]`. For example, the following metadata server addresses are legal:
    - Using `etcd` as a metadata storage service: `“10.0.0.1:2379”` or `“etcd://10.0.0.1:2379”`.
    - Using `redis` as a metadata storage service: `“redis://10.0.0.1:6379”`
    - Using `http` as a metadata storage service: `“http://10.0.0.1:8080/metadata”`

- `local_server_name`: The local server name, ensuring uniqueness within the cluster. It also serves as the name of the RAM Segment that other nodes refer to the current instance (i.e., Segment Name).
- `ip_or_host_name`: The name used for other clients to connect, which can be a hostname or IP address.
- `rpc_port`: The rpc port used for interaction with other clients.
- Return value: If successful, returns 0; if TransferEngine has already been init, returns -1.

```cpp
  ~TransferEngine();
```

Reclaims all allocated resources and also deletes the global meta data server information.

## Using Transfer Engine to Your Projects
### Using C/C++ Interface
After compiling Mooncake Store, you can move the compiled static library file `libtransfer_engine.a` and the C header file `transfer_engine_c.h` into your own project. There is no need to reference other files under `src/transfer_engine`.

During the project build phase, you need to configure the following options for your application:
```bash
-I/path/to/include
-L/path/to/lib -ltransfer_engine
-lnuma -lglog -libverbs -ljsoncpp -letcd-cpp-api -lprotobuf -lgrpc++ -lgrpc
```

### Using Golang Interface
To support the operational needs of P2P Store, Transfer Engine provides a Golang interface wrapper, see `mooncake-p2p-store/src/p2pstore/transfer_engine.go`.

When compiling the project, enable the `-DWITH_P2P_STORE=ON` option to compile the P2P Store example program at the same time.

### Using Rust Interface
Under `mooncake-transfer-engine/rust`, the Rust interface implementation of TransferEngine is provided, and a Rust version of the benchmark is implemented based on the interface, similar to [transfer_engine_bench.cpp](../../mooncake-transfer-engine/example/transfer_engine_bench.cpp). To compile the rust example, you need to install the Rust SDK and add `-DWITH_RUST_EXAMPLE=ON` in the cmake command.

## Advanced Runtime Options
For advanced users, TransferEngine provides the following advanced runtime options, all of which can be passed in through **environment variables**.
