# Mooncake Architecture

Mooncake aims to enhance the inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs), especially in slow object storage environments, by constructing a multi-level caching pool on high-speed interconnected DRAM/SSD resources. Compared to traditional caching, Mooncake utilizes (GPUDirect) RDMA technology to transfer data directly from the initiator's DRAM/VRAM to the target's DRAM/SSD in a zero-copy manner, while maximizing the use of multi-NIC resources on a single machine.

Mooncake:
- provides object-level data storage services
- supports data replication in the cache layer, with a lightweight design due to not guaranteeing high availability
- ensures the atomicity of object write operations, meaning a `Get` operation will always read one consistent version, but not necessarily the latest one
- supports striping and parallel I/O transfer for larger objects to utilize the aggregated bandwidth of multiple network cards
- supports multiple modes for flushing slow object storage
- supports dynamic addition and removal of cache resources

## Architectural Overview
![architecture](../../image/mooncake-store.png)
- Mooncake provides object-level operations, i.e. `Get/Put/List/Del`, and also supports dynamically configurating replication strategies (`Replicate` operations);
- Mooncake supports zero-copy and multi-NIC data transfer over VRAM/DRAM/NVMe SSD. This feature is supported by Transfer Engine, which has been open-sourced;
- **The master node** centrally manages the mappings of objects to VRAM/DRAM/NVM buffers. The master node also drives **managed pool buffer nodes** to achieve data transfer by calling Transfer Engine's APIs;
- **Managed pool buffer nodes** mainly provide DRAM space for storing objects.

> Mooncake has open-sourced the Transfer Engine subsystem, and updates are forthcoming!
